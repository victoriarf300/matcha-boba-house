When I asked Copilot to review the code it generated, it pointed out a potential issue with script loading order. It explained that if script.js were moved into the <head>, it would need the defer attribute to avoid accessing DOM elements too early. Since the script is currently loaded at the bottom of the page, no major changes were needed. The self-review helped me better understand why script placement is important.

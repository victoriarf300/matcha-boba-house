When I asked Copilot to review the code it generated, it pointed out a potential issue with script loading order. It explained that if script.js were moved into the <head>, it would need the defer attribute to avoid accessing DOM elements too early. Since the script is currently loaded at the bottom of the page, no major changes were needed. The self-review helped me better understand why script placement is important.

Part 3 below:
I built a search filter feature for the menu page of my Matcha Boba House website. The feature allows users to type into a search input and see menu items update in real time. Working with micro-iteration felt a little slow at first, but it quickly became helpful. Breaking the feature into small steps made it easier to understand what each change was doing before moving on. When I asked Copilot to review the code it generated, it pointed out a potential issue with script loading order.(pasted that above). I used GitHub Copilot Agent for this assignment. I liked that it could make focused changes and explain what files were modified during each step.
